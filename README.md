## Overview

As per the [European Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework Trust Model](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/blob/main/docs/architecture-and-reference-framework-main.md),

+ Relying Parties are registered by a Relying Party Registrar in their Member State.
+ As a result of the registration, a Relying Party receives an access certificate (WRPAC) from a Relying Party Access CA and a registration certificate (WRPRC).

+ The RP access certificate is used by the Wallet Instance to authenticate the Relying Party Instance.
+ The RP registration certificate is used by the Wallet Instance to access the intended use and attribute access policies of a WRP.

+ Relying Party authentication is a process whereby a Relying Party proves its identity to a Wallet Instance, in the context of a transaction in which the Relying Party requests the Wallet Instance to release some attributes.
+ Relying Party authentication is included in the protocol used (both in ISO/IEC 18013-5 and OpenID4VP) by a Wallet Instance and a Relying Party Instance to communicate.

The Relying Party Registration complies with the requirements set out by the [CIR 2025/848](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2025/848/oj), [TS5](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts5-common-formats-and-api-for-rp-registration-information.md) and [TS6](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts6-common-set-of-rp-information-to-be-registered.md).

The RP access certificate format complies with [ETSI TS 119 411-8](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/11941108/01.01.01_60/ts_11941108v010101p.pdf).
The RP registration certificate format complies with [ETSI TS 119 475](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/119475/01.02.01_60/ts_119475v010201p.pdf).

The Relying Party Registration Service provides two main functionalities:

+ Register a new Relying Party, issuing the Relying Party Instance certificate and keypair in pkcs#12 (P12) format.
+ List the certificates issued and enable their revocation.

For registering a new Relying Party, the relying party is asked to provide the following information:

+ Country in which the relying party is established
+ Name of the relying party as stated in an official record 
+ Common Name of the Relying Party, in a format suitable for presenting to an end-user
+ Registration number as stated in an official record together with identification data of that official record;
+ Contact details (address, e-mail and phone number) of the relying party 
+ Intended use of European Digital Identity Wallets, including an indication of the data to be requested by the relying party from users. (max of 500 chars)
+ Password to secure the private key

After the register information is provided, the Relying Party Access CA issues automatically the Relying Party instance certificate, and the user downloads the Relying Party Instance certificate and keypair in P12 format.


You can use the Relying Party registration service at https://registry.serviceproviders.eudiw.dev/, or install it locally.

    ```

6. Run the Project

    ```shell
    flask --app app run
    ```

## Run

### 1. Database
     
To create the database use the [app/relying_party_reg.sql](app/relying_party_reg.sql) file. It has been tested with MariaDB version 11.5.
  
The file [app/app_config/database.py](app/app_config/database.py) is used to configure the data needed to connect to the database.



### 2. EJBCA
  
The service needs a connection to an EJBCA (<https://www.ejbca.org/>) instance, in order to issue the certificates.
The configuration file for defining access credentials and the location of the admin's PKCS#12 Keystore file and its corresponding password can be found at [app/app_config/EJBCA_config.py](app/app_config/EJBCA_config.py).

+ clientP12ArchiveFilepath - Path for the .p12 needed for the client certificate authentication
+ clientP12ArchivePassword - .p12 password
+ certificateProfilename - Certificate Profile Name already created in EJBCA
+ endEntityProfileName - End Entity Profile name already created in EJBCA
+ username - End Entity username
+ password - End Entity password

### 3. Status List Service

According to ETSI 119 475 - V1.2.1, the WRPRC must be associated with a Status List to provide information about the WRPRC’s validity.

The WRPRC shall ensure that each WRPRC includes a reference to:
• the status list’s unique identifier (e.g., URI); and
• the position index assigned to that WRPRC within the status list.

To this effect, integration with the [eudi-srv-statuslist-py](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-srv-statuslist-py) service was implemented. 

The connection is made via the **url_statuslist** defined in the file [app/app_config/config.py](app/app_config/config.py)

## Overview

The WRP Registry API allows users to authenticate using PID/OID4VP, manage legal entities and wallet relying parties, and generate certificates.

The implementation of the WRP Registrar service and the database it uses complies with the following standards:

+ [CIR 2025/848](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2025/848/oj),
+ [TS5](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts5-common-formats-and-api-for-rp-registration-information.md)
+ [TS6](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-doc-standards-and-technical-specifications/blob/main/docs/technical-specifications/ts6-common-set-of-rp-information-to-be-registered.md)


The RP access certificate format complies with [ETSI TS 119 411-8](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/11941108/01.01.01_60/ts_11941108v010101p.pdf).

The RP registration certificate format complies with [ETSI TS 119 475](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/119475/01.02.01_60/ts_119475v010201p.pdf).

## Explanation of how to register a WRP with the Registrar Service

Authentication via the European Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW), using the PID document, is currently being implemented as part of a trial phase.

Following authentication, the user must register the Natural Person or Legal Person responsible for the Legal Entity associated with the WRP.

Once the Person has been registered, the user can then register at least one Legal Entity. Next, they must register at least one Provider and, finally, at least one WRP.

They must also register at least one intended use and one credential to specify the required information when a Wallet-Relying Party with the role of a Service Provider is requesting data from a Wallet Unit

Once the WRP has been registered, an access certificate can be issued for the WRP and a registration certificate for each intended use.

To summarise the order of the process:

> **Natural Person/Legal Person → Legal Entity → Provider → Wallet Relying Party → Intended Use → Credential**

## Swagger

Full API documentation is available through Swagger UI.

```
/apidocs/
```

---

*WRP Registry API Guide*
The API uses an authentication flow based on OID4VP and PID verification.

The authentication process works as follows:

1. Start the authentication flow and obtain a QR Code and `presentation_id`
2. Wait for PID authorization validation
3. Retrieve the authenticated user's `hash_pid`
4. Use the `hash_pid` in authenticated endpoints

---

## Authentication Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/authentication` | Start authentication flow and generate QR Code |
| GET | `/pid_authorization` | Validate PID authorization status |
| GET / POST | `/getpidoid4vp` | Retrieve PID data and obtain `hash_pid` |

---

## Authentication Flow Description

### 1. `/authentication`

Starts the authentication process.

Returns:
- QR Code for wallet authentication
- `presentation_id`

The QR Code must be scanned by the user's wallet application.

---

### 2. `/pid_authorization`

Checks whether the PID authorization was completed successfully.
This endpoint waits for the authentication result and validates the received PID authorization.

---

### 3. `/getpidoid4vp`

Retrieves the PID data obtained through the OID4VP flow.

Returns:
- User PID information
- Generated `hash_pid`

The returned `hash_pid` must be used in authenticated API requests.

## API Documentation

All available endpoints, request parameters, request body schemas, response formats, and example requests can be consulted through the Swagger API documentation.

The Swagger interface provides an interactive environment where users can explore and test every available endpoint.

| Environment | URL                                                    |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Local       | `http://localhost:5000/apidocs/`                       |
| Online      | `https://registry.serviceproviders.eudiw.dev/apidocs/` |

The Swagger documentation should be considered the primary reference for the API specification, as it is kept up to date with the latest endpoint definitions and supported request/response formats.

--- 
## End-to-End Example
The following example demonstrates a complete registration workflow using the REST API.

The commands below illustrate the typical sequence of requests required to:

* authenticate the user and obtain a hash_pid.
* register all required resources.
* generate a Registration Certificate.
* generate an Access Certificate.

The example uses curl commands and sample values that comply with the referenced technical specifications. Replace identifiers returned by each step (e.g. law_id, provider_id, wrp_id) with the values obtained from your own deployment.

| Step | Endpoint                 | Purpose                           |
